This script converts an exported deck from AnkiApp (https://www.ankiapp.com/) â€” an XML file â€” into a TXT file that can be imported into Anki.
Tested only with simple cards (furigana/English).

 How it works

* The addon processes lines in the following format:

  ```
  And = Soshite / sorede  
  But = shikashi / demo / data
  ```
* The addon converts the part before the equal sign to one side of the card, and the part after â€” to the other side.

* Lines that **do not contain `=` or `-` are ignored**
